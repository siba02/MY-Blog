## Introduction to AWS.

### What is AWS? And a quick history of AWS?

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is the world’s biggest cloud computing platform. It gives you tools like storage, servers, databases, and machine learning—all over the internet (aka “the cloud”).  
With AWS, companies don’t need to buy and manage physical hardware. Instead, they can run websites, apps, and more using powerful tools on-demand.

A Quick History of AWS:

* **2002** – Amazon starts building internal tools for storage and computing.
    
* **2006** – AWS officially launches with its first services:  
    👉 S3 (Simple Storage Service)  
    👉 EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
    
* **2010s**: AWS explodes in popularity, dominating the cloud market by offering flexible pricing (pay-as-you-go), scalability, and an ever-expanding toolkit.
    
* **2015–2020** – It grows fast and becomes a huge part of Amazon’s business.  
    Netflix, NASA, Airbnb, and others run on AWS.
    
* **Today** – AWS powers a huge portion of the internet. It supports everything from startups to Fortune 500 companies and global governments.
    

## 🌍 **Global Infrastructure: Regions & Availability Zones.**

AWS has a **global network** of data centers to help deliver fast, reliable, and secure cloud services.

* **Region**: A physical location in the world (like US-East or Europe-West) with multiple data centers.
    
* **Availability Zone (AZ)**: A group of **one or more data centers** in a region. They're close enough to work together, but separate enough to stay safe from outages.
    

**Why it matters:**  
This setup gives you **high availability** and **low latency**, so your apps stay online and fast—even if one part of the system goes down.

## ☁️ **Cloud Computing vs Traditional Hosting**

| Feature | Traditional Hosting | Cloud Computing (AWS) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🖥️ Hardware | You manage physical servers | AWS handles the servers |
| ⚙️ Scalability | Hard to scale quickly | Instantly scalable |
| 💸 Cost | Pay upfront | Pay-as-you-go |
| ⏱️ Setup Time | Days/weeks | Minutes |
| 🔧 Maintenance | You handle everything | AWS handles most of it |
| 🌐 Flexibility | Limited | Highly flexible & global |

**In short:**  
Cloud computing is **faster, cheaper, and more flexible** than the old way of hosting websites or apps.

## 💸 **Understanding the AWS Free Tier & Pricing**

### 🆓 **Free Tier**

Great for beginners or testing!

* **12 months free** – includes services like:
    
    * EC2 (750 hours/month)
        
    * S3 (5GB storage)
        
    * RDS, Lambda, and more
        
* **Always free** – lightweight usage of some services (e.g., Lambda requests, DynamoDB reads/writes)
    

### 💰 **Pricing Model**

* **Pay-as-you-go** – Only pay for what you use.
    
* **Savings Plans/Reserved Instances** – Commit to longer usage to save money.
    
* **Tiered pricing** – The more you use (e.g., storage or data transfer), the cheaper it can get per unit.
    

**Pro tip:**  
Use the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/addService) to estimate your costs before starting.
